Designing an Interactive Puzzle to Assess Soft Skills

Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to design an interactive puzzle that assesses soft skills of users such as eye for detail, perseverance, curiosity, and problem-solving skills. The interactive puzzle will be a treasure hunt game, where the users will follow a trail of clues to find hidden objects. The puzzle will incorporate direct or subtle methods of measuring the soft skills. 

Features:

The website will have the following features:

1. User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their email address and password.

2. Puzzle with Clues: The puzzle will have a minimum of 5 clues, where each clue will lead the users to the next clue. The clues can be in the form of text, videos, 3D animations, games, links, or anything else that the users have to find or solve. 

3. Dead-Ends: The puzzle will have a minimum of 2 dead-ends, where the users will not be able to proceed further. The dead-ends will test the user's perseverance, curiousity, time management, critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
